>Miracles sometimes occur, but one has to work terribly for them.

Hello, everyone. My name is li bei. I am a non - orthodox yuan. I like strange and interesting things, curious and passionate about learning what I'm interested in.


"Into" the "pit" comes from the university of web design class, I never contact code, found by some code label can be web pages they want to draw a picture, it is more amazing than brush (now think at the beginning of silly, it), and from then on, just changed my knowledge learning path. After a period of high school education, I have learned a lot. But then it will continue to work hard.
